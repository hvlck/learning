# override-default-styles

A simple FireFox WebExtension to override default browser styles.

I don't have any intention of submitting this to FireFox Addons.

## Roadmap

+ ~~CSS Preview Page~~

## Usage

Note: any changes will be applied after the page is reloaded.

Stylesheets can be changed and forced on all pages by navigating to the extension's options page.  All data can also be wiped on the options page.
